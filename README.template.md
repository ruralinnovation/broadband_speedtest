The official [NDT7](https://github.com/m-lab/ndt-server) Javascript client
libraries. This code works with Node.js >= 12, in a browser, and is the
source for the npm package `ndt7`.

Includes an example web client and an example node.js client in the `examples/`
directory. Pull requests gratefully accepted if you would like to write a
more sophisticated web or CLI client that uses the returned measurements to
debug network conditions.
